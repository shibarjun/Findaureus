<h1 align="center" style="margin-top: 0px;">Find bacteria across confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) obtained infected bone tissue images.</h1>

## Installation

Download and run the .exe file from the link below

[Find*aureus*](https://imagein.bmd-software.com/s/pA2L6uVsXu9ICGn)

Find*aureus* currently supports only *.czi* (Carl Zeiss) file extensions due to the limited variety of datasets available. Users are encouraged to report any bugs via the Issues page on GitHub or via below contact. As the application becomes more widely used, we will have the opportunity to interact with a wider range of file extensions and improve the application in future updates.

## Summary

Osteomyelitis is a serious bone infetion where fluorescence imaging provides a detailed visualization of bone cells, structure, and bacteria from infected bone tissues. However, the resulting images can be complex and challenging to analyze, particularly when it comes to locating bacteria. 

Find*aureus* is an open-source Python-based application that helps researchers and clinicians quickly and accurately locate bacteria or bacterial regions in fluorescence images of infected bone tissue. This application provides easy-to-use tools and extracts relevant information, making it a powerful tool for researchers and clinicians alike. Find*aureus* has been compared to state-of-the-art algorithms and validated by real users from various research and clinical institutions, demonstrating its effectiveness in helping to identify and locate bacteria in infected bone tissue.

## Demo

Currently, the dataset used in building the application is not available as open source due to ongoing scientific research purposes. Therefore, no demonstration files are available. However, hands-on demonstrations can be requested upon request.
