Findaureus, currently under testing, is being evaluated using CZI (Carl Zeiss) file extensions dataset. This choice is driven by the limited variety of datasets available for testing purposes. However, it's worth noting that the software is designed to accommodate other image file extensions as well, specifically ND2 (Nikon) and LIF (Leica). Users are encouraged to report any bugs via the Issues page on GitHub or via below contact. As the application gains wider usage, we will have the opportunity to engage with various file extensions, diverse tissue types, and bacteria. This will allow us to enhance the application through future updates, ensuring its continual improvement.

## Summary

Osteomyelitis is a serious bone infection where fluorescence imaging provides a detailed visualization of bone cells, structure, and bacteria from infected bone tissues. However, the resulting images can be complex and challenging to analyze, particularly when it comes to locating bacteria. 

Findaureus is an open-source Python-based application that helps researchers and clinicians quickly and accurately locate bacteria or bacterial regions in fluorescence images of infected bone tissue. This application provides easy-to-use tools and extracts relevant information, making it a powerful tool for researchers and clinicians alike. Findaureus has been compared to state-of-the-art algorithms and validated by real users from various research and clinical institutions, demonstrating its effectiveness in helping to identify and locate bacteria in infected bone tissue.
